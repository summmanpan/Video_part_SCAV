not document it and take you guys along

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,800
with this journey this is something new

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,320
and this is something i've never done

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,560
before because it's my first time moving

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,279
out of my house and living in an actual

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,320
home by myself and honestly waking up

173
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,280
a homeless man or whatever some random

174
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,440
man assaulted me on the sidewalk he

175
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
pushed me to like the building wall and

176
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,759

177
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
side on the building and like i i'm not

178
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,759
even being dramatic right now i think i

179
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,599
have a bruise right here he like shoved

180
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,479
me anyways that just reminded me i

181
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,279
should go buy myself pepper spray and a

182
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,120
taser gun or something so that i could

183
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
keep myself safe

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,480
life one thing i realized is there are

190
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
so many nice people in new york like 10

191
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,480
different people offered to help and i

192
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,040
was like oh thank you but no thank you

193
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,399
there are some really nice people but

194
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,480
there are also really mean people like

195
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
the guy who shoved me against the wall

196
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
literally i never thought that that

197
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,000
would ever happen to me but it just did

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,399
so i'm kind of in a mental shock right

199
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,000
now but

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
look at the view look at the sunset

201
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,120
today guys it's so pretty oh why am i so

202
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
tired i literally did one thing i

203
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
couldn't even buy myself a nail clipper

204
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,640
my nails still broken it looks so ugly

205
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:48,500

all right well my tv is finally set up

210
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,240
this looks kind of depressing like it's

211
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
so tiny on the floor but the tv stand

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
didn't come yet so it's gonna be on the

213
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
floor for now it looks a little

214
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
depressing

215
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,000
