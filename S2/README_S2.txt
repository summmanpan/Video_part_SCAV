    2) Create a new container 
    3) Search the broadcasting standard type of the MP4 container
    4) Download and integrate subtitles for the video
    0) Exit

The program is designed to be easy for users to enter the file video name

Also, it checks if there is a possible error so it requires repeating the 
input again.
